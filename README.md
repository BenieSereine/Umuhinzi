# Umuhinzi

Welcome to umuhinzi system. 

This system is all about helping farmers know when the weather is good to cultivate, what kind of crops to cultivate and which district in which to cultivate them. This is because not all crops grow the same in all the areas or in all kind of seasons.

This system is to help the farmers know all about that.
